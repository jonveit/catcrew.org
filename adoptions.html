		<h2> Adoptions </h2>
    		<hr />
    		<p>	The animals we have for adoption are friendly cats that have been rescued from the street as part of a TNR (Trap Neuter Return) program.  All of our cats for adoption are altered, vaccinated and healthy.  Each cat has tested negative for FIV (feline aids) as well as FeLV (feline leukemia) unless otherwise stated on their description.  </p>
            <p> All potential adopters must complete our adoption application.  We ask for a small donation to assist us with the fees incurred to ensure all cats and kittens are vaccinated and spayed/neutered, as well as supporting our outdoor feral feeding program. We are not an animal shelter and cannot accept surrendered animals.  </p>

            	<h3> Iliana </h3>
            	<p> Iliana is a senior kitty, about 10 years old.  She has been living in a managed colony in Norristown for many years and is now in foster care.  She is a real sweetheart, calm and gentle.  She is still a bit shy at first  due to her life outdoors but will come around quickly with belly rubs and canned food.  She truly deserves a happy retirement! </p>

                <h3> Bo </h3>
                <p> Bo was found trying to survive in an alley off of Dekalb Street in Norristown.  He was miserable, having to deal with the snow, the cold and the cars. Bo is now so happy to be off the street!! He likes to be the only cat, warm, with plenty of food and a nice bed to lay on. He is very laid back and content to just be himself.  He likes to be petted, loves his catnip and would make a lovely and gentle pet.  He is also a talker.  Please consider giving bo the second chance he deserves.</p>

              <h3>Gonzo</h3> 
              	<p>Gonzo is a survivor. His colony caretaker noticed the broken jaw which made it impossible for him to eat or drink for more than a week.  He was in great pain and became elusive.  We finally trapped him, got him to the vet and he underwent surgery.  His jaw is slightly off center now, but he can eat and drink normally.  He had the will to live and is now awaiting that special person to give him a safe, forever home.  Gonzo is shy at first but will come around quickly given a chance.  He is adorable and so easy-going. </p>

                <h3> Roger </h3> 
                <p> Roger is a large and lovable boy with beautiful green eyes.  He absolutely is enamored with humans, will happily ride on your shoulders wherever you choose to take him.  He is ok with some cats, but is not fond of most other males.  He really just wants you to himself.  Roger is a Norristown rescue and has been in foster care for more than a year. Please consider giving him his permanent home. </p>
